1.Apply Q-learning as the primary reinforcement learning algorithm for training the AI agent.
2.Utilize a Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture, employing a simple linear layer model for the naive state space and a CNN model for the screenshot state space.
3.Integrate an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation during the decision-making process.
4.Visualize and monitor the training progress using the Matplotlib library
5. Implement a memory replay mechanism to store and sample experiences during training, aiming to break correlations between consecutive experiences and stabilize the training process.
